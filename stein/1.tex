\chapter{Chapter 1}
In this chapter, we will introduce two useful covering lemmas, and prove that the maximal function is weak type (1,1) and strong $(p,p)$. Then we will prove Calderon-Zygmund decomposition, a scheme where we can ``cut'' functions using maximal functions. Then we will prove a general result about Calderon-Zygmund operators, i.e., they are weak (1,1) and hence strong $(p,p)$. Then we will do some examples and discuss some further results.



Now we prove the following theorem about operators of a certain form.
\begin{thm}
    Let $T$ be an operator that is $\|Tf\|_q\leq A\|f\|_q$, for all $f\in L^q$, and satisfies 
    \begin{equation*}
        \int_{B^c(y,c\delta)}|K(x,y)-K(x,\overline{y})|dx\leq A, \overline{y}\in B(y,\delta)
    \end{equation*}
    Then $T$ is bounded on $L^p\cap L^q$, for $1<p<q$.
\end{thm}
